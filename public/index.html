                    <h1>About us</h1>
                    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                    <p>Buckhorn Resources is actively purchasing mineral, royalty and overriding royalty interests across the continental United States. We purchase royalty interests in all the major shale gas plays such as the Haynesville Shale, Barnett Shale, Fayetteville Shale, and Marcellus Shale as well as shale oil plays such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford. We offer owners very generous lump-sum payouts, providing them the freedom to use the proceeds in any way they wish while alleviating them of worries about their erratic and inevitably declining royalty checks. </p>
                    
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>We currently are purchasing non-producing mineral acreage.</p></li>
                        <li><p>We do purchase royalties averaging less than $50 per month.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                      It is our goal to extend you the most aggressive offer to buy your royalties. We perform a rigorous engineering evaluation of each property in order to assess the maximum value of each royalty package.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We understand how important of a decision it is to make when it comes to selling your mineral rights. Buckhorn Resources takes pride in helping you make an informed decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There is never any obligation or pressure to sell; and if we do buy royalties from you, we will complete all closing details at our expense.
                    </p>

                <h1>Reasons To Sell</h1>
                <p>Selling your property mineral rights offers several advantages:</p>
                 <ul>
                   <li><p>Cash flow needs due to unforeseen circumstances.</p></li>
                   <li><p>As an heir you may prefer cash instead of ownership of oil or gas royalties or mineral rights.</p></li>
                   <li><p>As a royalty or mineral rights owner you may wish to simplify your investments.</p></li>
                   <li><p>You may prefer a lump sum of cash instead of smaller payments over time.</p></li>
                   <li><p>You may feel uncomfortable with the management of royalties or mineral rights.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Your assets are converted from depleting to non-depleting.</p></li>
                   <li><p>You may wish to liquidate now to avoid future risk of oil or gas or mineral prices decline.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Paying off debt, such as high-interest credit card balances, medical bills, a mortgage, or a car loan.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Applying the lump sum toward important family priorities, such as college expenses, a home improvement project, or even a well-deserved family vacation.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Taking advantage of the lowest long-term capital gains tax rate since the Great Depression (15%) while it lasts.                  </p></li>

                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <dl>
                  <dt><p><strong>How long will it take to sell my royalties and receive my lump-sum payment?</strong></p></dt>
                  <dd><p>Our acquisition representatives are standing by now to begin our assessment of your royalty holdings. Once we hear from you, our goal is to extend you an offer within 24 hours. If you accept our offer, we will complete our pre-closing due diligence and issue payment right away. Depending on your situation and your royalty holdings, we can expedite this process for payment within a matter of a few days or even a few hours. </p></dd>
                  
                  <dt><p><strong>How does Buckhorn Resources determine an offer amount? </strong></p></dt>
                  <dd><p>We perform an in depth assessment of each royalty interest in order to extend the most generous offer possible. This assessment involves reviewing the production history of each well and forecasting future production using petroleum engineering best practices. We combine these forecasted production volumes with aggressive market expectations for future oil and gas prices in projecting royalty payments over the remaining productive life for each well. The end result of this process is a professionally-engineered, fair-market valuation that in most cases would cost the individual royalty owner thousands of dollars to have done by a third-party engineering firm.</p></dd>

                  <dt><p><strong>Do all mineral and royalty interests lose value over time?</strong></p></dt>
                  <dd><p>Yes. Oil and gas reserves are finite, and every oil and gas well is destined to be plugged and abandoned. So, although royalty income can increase in the short term due to rises in oil and gas prices or production enhancement projects, you can be certain that your royalty checks will decline over the long run and will one day stop coming.</p></dd>

                <dt><p><strong>Why does Buckhorn Resources want to buy my royalty interests?</strong></p></dt>
                <dd><p>Royalties are worth more to our investors than they are to most individuals and institutions. This is because our investors are able to significantly reduce the uncertainty of royalty income.</p>

                    <p>They do this in two ways. First, they diversify their investments. That is to say, they own interests in thousands of wells. So, the risk that one well will unexpectedly go down is offset by the thousands of other wells they own. Second, our investors have the capability to hedge oil and gas prices. In effect, they lock in today’s oil and gas prices by assuring that the shortfalls in royalty income that would result from falling oil and gas prices would be made up in gains on their futures contract investments.</p>
                    <p>Our investors are able to limit the risks of holding minerals and royalties in ways that most of us can’t. Lower risk means higher value resulting in higher lump-sum payouts for you.</p>
                </dd>
                
                <dt><p><strong>What documentation is required if I decide to sell my Royalty or Mineral rights?</strong></p></dt>
                <dd><p>For oil or gas royalties we will require the most recent check statements from the oil or gas producer. </p>
                    <p>For non-producing mineral rights we will need a legal description of the property.</p>
